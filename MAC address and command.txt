STEP 1: Configuring the Wi-Fi settings
Open Arduino IDE.
Connect your SCK via USB.
From the Tools > Board menu, choose the right USB port (generally the last one).
From the Tools > Serial port menu, select the right board. This is Leonardo for SCK v1.0 (Goteo) or LilyPad Arduino USB for SCK v1.1 (Kickstarter).
Open the serial monitor window in the Arduino IDE (button at the top-right of the main window).
Set the options to “115200 baud” and “No line return” (drop-down menu at the bottom-right of the monitor window).
Wake up the module and activate the Wi-Fi command mode by typing in the serial monitor:
$$$
Change to “Carriage return” option (drop-down menu at the bottom-right of the monitor window)
Add a new SSID to memory by typing:
set wlan ssid XXXNote: You have to replace XXX with your ssid name, filling any space with the dollar ($) character. Due to hardware limitations it can’t be longer tham 32 characters.
Add a new phrase to memory (optional, password for WPA1 & WPA2):
set wlan phrase XXXNote: You have to replace XXX with your phrase, filling any space with the dollar ($) character.
Add a new key to memory (optional, password for WEP & WEP64):
set wlan key XXX
Add an authentication method into memory (replace XXX by “0” for Open, “1” for WEP, “2” for WPA1, “4” for WPA2, “8” for WEP64):
set wlan auth XXX
Add an antenna type into memory (replace XXX by “0” to use the internal antenna or “1” if you use an external antenna):
set wlan ext_antenna XXX
Get the MAC address of the kit by typing:
get mac
Copy/Save the answer for further use.
Exit and go back to the normal operational mode by typing:
exit

MAC: 00:06:66:3a:1c:e9
